First of all, if any of you want, you can check the app in here: http://cocktailarino.herokuapp.com/

This small web application was redone in about 14-15h of work.

Redid it all by scratch and has alot of things that should be improved.

But all and all, will move on to another more complex project and in there will try to be more cautious and have better planing. Especially design wise.

Was a cool experience having to deal with all the features alone.
Especially reading documentation on heroku deployment and cloudinary.
